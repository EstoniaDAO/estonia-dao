# estonia-dao

The Estonia DAO is a decentralised organisation that will be connected with the Estonia E-resident authentication system. There are already 60,000+ Estonia E-residents from around the world, including long-time blockchain supporter Tim Draper who was the 2nd ever Estonia E-resident.

Estonia DAO is a fun experiment that will enable Estonia e-residents to:

Hold and manage digital currencies on behalf of all Estonia E-residents
Create and participate in on-chain votes (including how funds should be allocated)
Allow individuals to donate digital assets to ALL Estonia E-residents
Act a Basic Income distribution system to Estonia E-residents
Unlike most other DAOs, this one would ensure that the identity of each token holder is known, leading to a potentially fairer governance model of 1 token = 1 vote, for each Estonia E-resident.
